Sheet 1
-------

1. Write a program that prints the multiplication table of 5 in the
   form:
	5 * 1 = 5
	5 * 2 = 10
	.
	.
	.
	5 * 12 = 60;

2. Extend the above program to write the multiplication tables of
   2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.
   Use as many loops as you want.

3. Write a program that performs the following operations:
   a) Ask the user to enter one integer number x
   b) if x > 0 then it prints x*x
   c) Ask the user if he wants another number. Get user reply by getch().
   d) if the user answers 'y' or 'Y', repeat steps (a) to (c)
   e) if the user replies anything else, go out.

4. Modify the program of problem (3) such that the user reply to (c)
   is restricted to 'Y' , 'y', 'n', or 'N'.
   Therefore, the steps are:

   a) Ask the user to enter one integer number x
   b) if x > 0 then it prints x*x
   c) Ask the user "Do you want another number?". Get user reply by getch().
   d) if the user answers 'y' or 'Y', repeat steps (a) to (c)
   e) if the user replies 'n' or 'N' go to step (g)
   f) if the user replies anything else, go to step (c)
   g) print "Good bye"

	Hint. You may need to use a do-while loop to get the user reply.
