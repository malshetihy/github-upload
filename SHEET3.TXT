1. Write a program to calculate the value of a determinant. The dimension
   of the determinant is given by the user and is 10 at most.

   Hints: * Use a two-dimensional array to store the determinant's elemnts
	  * Calculate the value using the Gaussian Elemination method (!!)

2. Write a program to multiply two matrices and store their product in
   a third matrix. Use two-dimensional array to store each matrix.

3. Think about Lagrange method. Review the formula and try to write a program!
